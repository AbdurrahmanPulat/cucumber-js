* We made a PR.

# What worked? What do you appreciate?

* I learned general concepts that I could use in other open source projects
* The issues were good for first timers. I'm keen to explore more now I've looked through them!
* It was so much fun! All the intimidation I had about starting to do this vanished. Low stakes way of learning new things. A nice way of learning new stuff!
* The team gelled almost instantly

# What was puzzling or frustrating?

* Why did the tests pass on your device but not mine?
* Live Share vs Screen Share it was a bit confusing
* Would it be easier to just run it locally on one of our machines? More realistic.
* Twitch setup
